1) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
.gitignore is a plain text file that contains the names of all the files and directories that should be ignored while performing a git commit. It usually contains file names from a project configuration file.
For a java project, .gitignore can contain jar and compressed files, and library packages.

2) What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A fast-forward in git is when you want to merge/combine files from 2 branches and the head of the checkout branch is the ancestor of the merge branch, so instead of doing a traditional merge commit, git just moves your branch pointer to point at the incoming commit. 

3) Why should you have different branches?
We should have different branches so that we do not cause compilation issues or merge conflicts on the main branch. We should always create a development/user-story branch and merge that with main after testing and resolving all issues.

4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Depending on the size and security and privacy roles, a project can have a single or multiple remote branches. For example, our semester project will have only 1 remote repository since it is a very small scale project.
